## How to Run

1. Have node v16+ installed. See [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) for installation.
2. Make sure you have `yarn` installed. It's more convenient than `npm`. Install `yarn` with `npm install --global yarn`.
3. `cd client`.
4. Install required client dependencies using `yarn`
5. `cd server`
6. Install required server dependencies using `yarn`
7. Add seed data to server `yarn seed`
8. Run the client with `yarn start` when you're in the client directory.
9. Run the server with `yarn start` when you're in the server directory.
10. Script to do this for you to come later...(maybe?)

## Running Test Script

1. cd server

3. npm test

## Running Server Seed
